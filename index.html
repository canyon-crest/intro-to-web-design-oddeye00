    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

      I'm Ian Rhee, a sophomore currently attending
      <a id="link-text-cca" href="https://www.sduhsd.net/Our-District/Our-Schools/Canyon-Crest-Academy/index.html" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>.
      I have deep passion for a variety of subjects: math, machine learning, and quantitative finance.
      Outside of academics, some hobbies of mine include speedcubing and writing. I officially got into cubing at the end of 6th grade,
      when my best friend at the time started learning it. Though I knew how to solve it from before, it was just the beginner’s method,
      so we were quite evenly matched. We used to constantly compete with each other to try and beat each other’s times.

    <h2>My Journey:</h2>
    <p id="p2">
      <img id="img-right" src="images/usamo.png" alt="USAMO Logo" />
      When I was young, I honestly hated math. Despite living in the U.S. my entire life, Korean was my first language,
      so learning English and making friends at school were very difficult for me. I often got bullied and was called stupid because
      I couldn’t understand something right away. My feeling about math changed entirely when I started performing really well in
      math competitions in elementary school, where other kids started looking up to me. That motivated me to pursue competitive math,
      and as of now I was able to qualify for the <a id="link-text-usamo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad" target="_blank">USA(J)MO</a>.

    <h2>Goals and Aspirations:</h2>

      <img id="img-left2" src="images/MIT.jpg" alt="MIT" />
      As an aspiring quantitative researcher, I want to further improve my skills in math, as well as deepen my knowledge in machine
      learning and quantitative finance. My goals in the near future are to try and get into the
      <a id="link-text-mop" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program" target="_blank">MOP</a>,
      publish research papers, and get into MIT.
